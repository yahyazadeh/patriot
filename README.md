# PatrIoT

This is the repository for PatrIoT instantiations for some major programmable IoT platforms. PatrIoT has been published in 20th International Conference on Runtime Verification ([RV 2020](https://rv20.ait.ac.at/pgm/)).

#### Directories:

* `patriot` contains the instrumentor and policies for runtime monitoring as well as the simulation testbeds.
* `patriot-rdlm` contains the https-based lock management server that handles synchronization for the SmartThings platform in our testbed. `patriot-rdlm` is adapted from [here](https://github.com/thefab/restful-distributed-lock-manager)
